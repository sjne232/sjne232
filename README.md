I am a Computer Science Engineer that graduated from the University of Kentucky in 2022!
Since then I have worked as a Digital Technology Intern for GE Appliances for two Rotations, and then 
took a job as an assistant project manager for a start up at HydroDistill. 

While at GEA I worked in ERP and as an Assistant Project Manager. Now I am looking for a short term 
Career change into data analystics or business analytics. I want to get a more technical role for a few years
before getting my MBA, and then transistioning back into IT PM. From there I will obtain my PMP. 

Most of my Github starting on 12/4/2024 will mainly showcase projects related to Data Analytics and my personal website!
